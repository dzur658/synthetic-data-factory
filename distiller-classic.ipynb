      "If I subtract 1/x from both sides: 2*(1/x) = 0. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that's correct. So 2/x = 0. Which is impossible because 2/x is never zero for any real x. \n",

But in the required format, the user might expect a boxed answer. But since there's no solution, maybe they want to write that. However, in standard practice, if no solution exists, it's often denoted as \"no solution\" or \"no real solution\". However, in some cases, the system might expect a specific format. Since the user hasn't specified, but the initial instruction says to put the final answer within \\boxed{}, and in some cases, for no solution, they might use \\boxed{\\text{No solution}}. But I'm not sure if that's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let me check again.\n",
